Step 1: Download and Install Sideloadly
Visit the official Sideloadly website: https://sideloadly.io/

Download the appropriate version of Sideloadly for your operating system (Windows or Mac).

Install Sideloadly by following the on-screen instructions.

Step 2: Connect Your iPhone/iPad to Your Computer
Use a USB cable to connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer.

On your iOS device, you may be prompted to Trust this computer. Click Trust and enter your device passcode.

Open Sideloadly on your computer.

Step 3: Sign In with Your Apple ID
In Sideloadly, sign in using your Apple ID.

You can use either your free Apple ID or a paid developer account.

If you're using a free Apple ID, be aware that you'll be limited to installing only 3 apps at a time, and the app will expire after 7 days.

Step 4: Select the USBank.ipa File
In Sideloadly, click on the “Select IPA” button.

Browse to the location where you have stored the USBank.ipa file and select it.

The IPA file will be ready for installation.

Step 5: Configure Device Settings
Ensure your iPhone/iPad is selected in the dropdown under “Device” in Sideloadly.

You can leave the default settings as they are for most cases, but if you wish, you can adjust the app name or signing options.

Step 6: Start the Sideloading Process
Once the USBank.ipa is selected and your device is connected, click the “Start” button.

The installation process will begin. Wait for Sideloadly to complete the sideloading process. This may take a few moments depending on the size of the app and your connection speed.

Step 7: Trust the Developer Profile on Your iOS Device
After the app is installed on your iPhone/iPad, you may encounter an error when trying to open the app, stating that the developer is not trusted.

To fix this:

Go to Settings > General > Device Management (or Profiles & Device Management).

Find the developer profile associated with your Apple ID.

Tap Trust to allow the app to open.

Step 8: Launch the USBank App
After trusting the developer profile, you can open the USBank app from your home screen.

Enjoy using the USBank app on your iPhone/iPad!

Troubleshooting
1. App Expiration:
Apps installed using a free Apple ID will expire after 7 days. To continue using the app, you will need to reinstall it via Sideloadly.

2. Provisioning Profile Errors:
If you see errors related to the provisioning profile, ensure your Apple ID is set up correctly for app installation. If you're using a free developer account, make sure you’re not exceeding the maximum limit of 3 apps installed at once.

3. App Not Launching:
If the app doesn’t launch or gives a trust error, follow the steps under "Step 7" to trust the developer profile again.
